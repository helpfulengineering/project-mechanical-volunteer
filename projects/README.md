# Mechanical Volunteer Projects

Mechanical Volunteer Projects are purpose built Pybossa UIs developed in HTML and Javascript to provide Pybossa users with a way to interact with the tasks they have been assigned.

See a [sample healthsites.io project](samples/healthsites/README.md) for an example of how build, run and test a new Pybossa project locally.
